warning spoilers included review doesnt really make much difference deep impact begins official summer movie season also brings back memories remember dantes peak came february months later volcano released first film smart one best disaster films ever seen latter film mess logic wasted talent well deja vu two disaster films go head head competition time unfortunately first comet flick bad people may shy away armageddon upcoming released beginning july course general reaction audience mine minority stood side dantes peak watching deep impact began wonder anyone right mind could actually like film apparently many utterly completely honest havent little fun watching disaster film entire life volcano implausibilities still rather fun watch deep impact doesnt implausibilities also contains cheap human drama incredibly horrible special effects poorly constructed plot thing gives half star bottom slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes good actors making characters deep impact begins unnamed year year advanced technology sets future fire sky showing local movie theater pushing back line students outside night dark sky among leo elijah wood sarah leelee sobieski leo

entire human race two years dust settle actually would take much much ninety years understand humans could come back surface start rest plot standard disaster film one subplot worth mentioning jenny father jason schell touching relationship forms impending doom final moment involving two characters heartfelt emotional shame nothing else heartfelt course know comet impact surface title alone suggests previews actually show tension drawn attempt stop comet know wont work director mimi leder came successful tries direction episodes hit television show er major film debut peacemaker pathetic heartless action film well time leder creating film worse one suggestion ms leder please stay away big screen least action genre much blame placed leder directly pace disastrously throughout film given subtitles tell us much time passed goes months weeks hours literally feels like time taking place boring course leder isnt blame screenwriters michael bruce joel rubin crafted simplistic story gets worse time starts promising soon turns deadly audience anyway chock full cheesy one liners know going sex anyone else school stupid characters might think back one subplots remotely interesting rest forgettable boring main plot outrageous cant figure film supposed action drama scifi put simply special effects film hit miss situation thats right miss hit scenes earth well done ship comet huge mistake making laughable frightening concept even trying land comet preposterous enough thats isnt actually humans walk surface give break ya course much hyped collision comet earth well far spectacular makes independence day look brilliant water rushing towards land effective hits continent effects turn ridiculous cgi water used looks bad heard laughs audience fact may even recommend film want see bad effects actually get days think visual effects cant improved along comes film show really one thing struck wrong note concerning mimi direction also influences actors leder loves show actors faces moments terror reminded another action director renny harlin die hard cliffhanger harlin succeeds shows faces victims realistic situations leder likes flaunt peoples fears via faces instead coming sympathetic leder seems one moment astronaut flying space enough warrant response audience leder wants go farther shows us persons face drifting space one ways emotional response audience one going fooled another note film picks pace last fifteen minutes comet actually pace pick emotional moments shown watch people cry loved ones obvious emotional mostly big trick rope viewers feeling characters didnt work anyway actors much given leoni bad boys tvs naked truth best film given role character made stronger presence grow care robert duvall energetic fun watch character turned shreds plot elijah wood also comes rather successfully still hasnt many good roles wood stick drama talented stuff vanessa redgrave barely performance enhanced strong presence screen schell distracting provide nice humor morgan freeman infinitely better gives one shallow performances date quite remarkable leelee sobieski could better think suffered poorly written character special note go ron eldard denise eldard good role limited plot special personally tvs star trek next generation seeing one highlights film overall talented cast virtually wasted deep impact rated disaster related elements brief language one worst films year omen things come summer could one worst ever luckily xfiles movie coming hopefully armageddon successful shame film successfully isnt worth much nearly million special effects done ilm huge shocker score composed james horner titanic one might expected fun witness experience well comet hit earth almost wish could take film along	0

friend fellow film critic ted said review phantom menace even write review never mind fact ive waiting new star wars movie since seven years old never mind fact everyone internet already discussed movie even released never mind theres much going movie terms plot action special effects longterm story analyze every aspect would take lot time energy still wouldnt cover everything also like ted reviews ill try review way different usual reviews instead write casually possible talking directly reader begin specific aspects film many general significant factors must considered get specifics film skip next four made obvious last several years another trilogy films produced account missing initial three installments star wars series first films actually episode four one george lucas creator series probably assumed people know trilogy star wars empire strikes back return jedi actually second trilogy media interviews past explained movies made order cant recall reasons new film writer director also assumed viewers least vaguely familiar storylines significant plot points first trilogy second trilogy well know mean order review many significant points must mentioned unfortunately may serve spoilers proceed caution critics note one personal policy intentionally analyze spoilers would like reviews able make sense reader viewing film reviewed would nearly impossible film justice without breaking rule critics note reviewing film also breaks universal critics law reviewing movies roger ebert movie many outside factors come play films plot significance part trilogy considering modern society would difficult impossible simply review film completely story first know film even going know young anakin skywalker grow become evil ruler darth vader also father luke skywalker lead successful revolution empire know obiwan ben kenobi trainer anakin ways force attempts become jedi knight would fail thus anakin would fall dark side also know something force kind universal force fate manipulated whose minds expanded enough believe feel jedi dont know sure history ruling galaxy likely much longer complex government earth one fascinating aspects first three films seemed subtle definite order complexity also seems supposed familiar details story come thousands comic books years since movies ended notably details regarding emperor empire jedi senator last name havent kept star wars years still way know details simply recognizing actor voice least phantom menace first chapter long saga one would assume basic would laid including history behind major factors series especially force jedi knights unfortunately film opposite simply builds top must history long detailed could never explained didnt liked aspect film one reasons falls short greatness youre going tell story beginning tell beginning possible trilogy complete could another trilogy episodes back story even digress ive said much yet havent even touched specifics film necessary elements go show vast story star wars series individual film get movie unlike three weve come know love since late films helps keep spirit series familiar time seems flaw filmmaking process since sometimes rings basic story rather complex even confusing times told army known trade federation set blockade around seemingly insignificant planet called naboo given many details back story federation purpose instead film opts get story moving quickly introduced two jedi master quigon jinn neeson apprentice obiwan kenobi mcgregor two acting sort hopes ending obvious federation planets queen amidala portman leader federation alien called following orders strange mythical character older human man whose face body covered black robe hood wears referred lord considering appearance especially creepy evil voice obviously one significant characters series digital never person clearly actual something wants keep secret would also reveal identity never openly revealed film clear viewers feeling well delve background next two films doesnt take film long spring action within minutes hero jedi fighting lives films story begins move along film doesnt one specific plot works manner films series get one adventure top another many film would describe gives movie hook films relied type storytelling limits technology time films screenplays also sense gives phantom menace unique traits already know film takes place least generation two original star wars trilogy means lot background unclear andor unexplained may beginning vast epic story significant storyline involving discovery anakin skywalker lloyd quigon jinn introduction jedi council briefly story jinn stumbles upon skywalker attempt buy parts queen spaceship damaged efforts free federation meeting tatooine mostly chance course jinn force jinn feel skywalker great natural power force another subplot involving bet skywalker fantastic race enter details significance begin reveal also provides new explanation force never mentioned fact seems something important upsetting never mentioned element seriously undermines mystical aspect force transforms something physical scientific completely unnecessary films third act major significant elements become tied together rather familiar execution plot funny reality star wars world seems embedded mythology new philosophy religion yet solution major conflicts series violence technique hasnt used movies reallife situations countless times throughout history least spirit ultimate powers good versus evil fun exciting matter border cartoonish sometimes thats film appealing

computeranimated films dont let fool disney definitely scared past two years broken studios volcano duel opinion dantes peak came way ahead predecessor time quality volcano original premise destroyed ridiculous situations twice many films first comet competition armageddon blew away dramatic deep impact even interesting one beloved studio disney goes newcomer dreamworks time tell im sure mr mouse nothing fear may sound like didnt like antz contrary id put toy story due pg rating many parents may put dialogue shouldnt appear disneys version dialogue antz pushes envelope film sexual profanity pop occasionally makes dreamworks animated feature geared adult crowd humor also written especially adults though many kids laughing theater attended type film made families often entertaining kids entertaining parents antz begins hilarious monologue seems woody allens shtick franz short story man wakes discover bug allen troubled ant believing made worker youre middle child family five million comments neglected childhood one night sitting bar friend weaver sylvester stallone discussing pathetic place life walks princess bala sharon stone one recognizes without crown bala asks would like dance engage pulp dance everyone else following leader discovering princess falls love theres problem bala getting married general gene hackman ruthless leader merely wants control better stronger colony order must eliminate queen anne bancroft weakest colony namely worker ants get rid queen needs get rid loyal army ants would willing die colonel christopher come plan send loyal ants battle surely killed queen reluctant first decides best colony meanwhile wants meet bala asks weaver army ant switch places gets sent battle manages survive slaughter battle sequence absolutely stunning though may flashbacks starship troopers contained similar sequence however antz film production around time similarities merely coincidence second half film revolves around kidnapping bala search mythical place called ant boss food wants adventures bala get surprisingly high tension especially one involving glass looming targets like independence day fact im going assume producers intentionally ants look awe beam fire ground visually exciting rush adrenaline dont fooled little kids shouldnt see may try copy seeing antz never intentionally step ant hopefully children learn killing ants rather cruel animated film antz probably best find date visually stunning dreams may come best aspect animation fact characters arent limited gravity take ridiculous situations make seem plausible one great moment involves mass worker ants form wrecking ball animation perfect virtually see every single ant ball however exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck bottom young boys shoe truly great example film making finest computer technology animators carefully made ants faces look similar actors providing voices best example would danny glover one point even see face although doubt ants also touching rather gruesome scene final words without body young kids may disturbed site head good deal humor derived appropriate adults course disneys bugs life looks good dont know able best dreamworks newest animated feature terms animation dreamworks done something studio could go head head big mouse knock yes anastasia good nearly good even worst disney vocal talent always essential animated feature antz one best seen since toy story fact far exceeds one woody allen always funny transcends hes done past years without body comic timing noticeable thing fact im pretty sure writers let improvise lot lines sharon stone bala shows comic ability though part stone works best dramatic actress sylvester stallone teamed stone beginning statement wants actor typecast action star oscars last year stallone proving serious comedic illustrated actor gene hackman superb general almost another take crimson tide persona christopher probably noticed voice many people remember hits batman returns anne bancroft minimal role shes effective nonetheless danny glover small role good job dan aykroyd jane also lend voices two unrecognizable especially aykroyd jennifer lopez plays worker ant falls love weaver although people wont recognize voice either many people recognize grant voice foreman played miles tv show murphy brown definitely huge cast highprofile names definitely help course probably tell lot million budget went also directors eric darnell lawrence relative newcomers though direct feature headless show incredible talent type picture tense times funny throughout two hold film together like professionals screenplay todd alcott chris weitz quite simple plot contains lot subtlety makes film suitable adults kids delight animation parents laugh humor go young childrens heads mean shouldnt take kids see lot fun watching one great themes given us part social commentary part romance story part moral drama antz gives everyone something talk whether animation discussions community thankfully subtle either aspects antz rated pg mild language intense action sometimes language pushing limits family movie violence keep kids home battle scene ants melting acid bugs death scene shows ant beam sunlight sexual perfect choice wholesome fun theaters doubt many children understand sexual unless old enough still leave really young children home

people enjoy science fiction often faced unpleasant surprises due novels stories comic books movies often science fiction aficionados find material previously science fiction pure fantasy supernatural horror rather simple cases mistakes understandable genre boundaries never clearly marked believe really cases movie science fiction actually happens straight historical epic thing occurred former fifteen years ago national distributors gave treatment right stuff film directed philip kaufman mistake distributors could explained fact official poster film features men space suits right stuff film isnt even fiction based book tom covering early years american space program plot film begins people heard edwards air force base major test site experimental planes major aim test flights determine ability aircraft reach speed thus break sound barrier many pilots tried achieve goal many paid lives bravado one quiet pilot chuck eager played sam shaped succeeds thus gives example whole new generation test pilots determined enter history books breaking new speed records ten years later soviets launched beginning space age order regain national us government decides first send man space best air force navy marine pilots recruited program yeager lacks college education desired image one critics right stuff named one among top films made high position could explained fact film looks quite atypical time three hours length epic scope looked suitable age hollywood used make films larger life real reason lies fact made truly remarkable talented filmmaker philip kaufman created reputation using opportunities golden age order create original memorable movies right stuff last swan song era producers allowed directors spend big bucks unusual artsy projects right stuff unusual lacks many standard elements hollywood film plot almost nonexistent coherent story featuring many interesting incidents anecdotes shifts focus old generation test pilots yeager new generation astronauts film also lacks conventional protagonist yeager also appears small cameo remains true hero film equal time exposure also given astronauts wives making movie ensemble piece gave opportunity kaufman use multitude great acting talents bit character roles sam shepard great yeager war hero whose greatest achievement sound barrier remained obscured history books probably due surface lacks personality compared hyped fortunate astronaut colleagues shepard gives texture character subtle gestures phrases performance followed great acting ed harris marine future politician john glenn young dennis quaid fine arrogant fighter jock cooper arrogance mirrored friend tragic figure virgil superbly played fred ward always reliable character actor scott glenn provides comic relief navy arguably first american man space alan shepard kaufman left room female talents barbara pamela reed veronica mary jo great pilots wives royal also impressive menacing figure preacher memorable performances belong donald johnson jane nurse great acting talent assembled film mirrored superb direction notable methods kaufman uses order suggest passage time beginning film shows test pilots living middle desert virtual unknowns far away strict rules discipline everything seems natural yeager indulge horse riding yards away fastest precious aircraft world setting quite normal important technical problems solved simple chainsaw test pilots report broken important flights times changing alliance replaced cold war natural pilots like yeager must replaced conventional pilots entire lives become focus media frenzy job subjected strict rules meticulous plans must fight politicians uncaring scientists like former nazi rocket expert von played scott beach preserve basic human dignity contrast beautifully edited sequence yeager final spectacular test flight absolute obscurity mercury astronauts receive fame fortune although even going space contrasts similar effects achieved superb use poetic movie language editing great photography caleb provides many memorable scenes like funeral desert astronauts suits walking slow motion image would copied many latter films although kaufman enjoyed support nasa american military provided authentic locations period equipment still use special effects order space flights effects excellent still fool audience accustomed cgi real footage earth outer space another fine contribution film oscar awarded musical score bill still excitement every time hear accompanied use songs used background also provide authentic atmosphere historical period film great cult status well deserved minor flaws mercury astronauts arent fleshed enough although played fine actors like lance henriksen film also lacks proper closure hand logical conclusion film landing moon would require film six hours long also critics prone attack film hard russians portrayed evil monsters line cold war rhetoric america contemporary interviews kaufman approach claiming wanted make film authentic possible order portrayed russians real life perceived americans early time passed dont see astronauts heroes age widespread satellite routine space missions men women space suits seen mere workers young boys want astronauts grow film sentimental reminder times future began perhaps could encourage least follow mercury astronauts footsteps seek new sky even decide stay earth could still appreciate right stuff extraordinary piece cinema	1

enough action film quite bit action dialogue essential wellwritten chase sequence long overly long creating quite bit suspense confusion perhaps watching alien video helped big screen overwhelmed something normally didnt see dark film language extremely harsh always figured alien series rely smart dialogue instead moronic dont get saying films eliminate swearing film dialogue remarks gets rather distracting however since seeing realize swearing mainly aspect restrained hatred characters result alien flaw albeit major one underdeveloped characters never really care get feeling many

shocker later leads surprise ending fincher apparently loves use closeups actors faces michael douglas clown faceoff game style actors hair thing look faces many critics didnt like actors bald makes complete sense taken context plot alien works take context story try compare predecessors finchers turn seems bit gloomy dark though thats always bad thing plot pretty much rehash first two films major twists setup several different characters one one picked however first two tons arsenal especially camerons film alien takes place planet devoid human life except rundown prison result weapons found creates lot tension although must admit fincher could added lot suspense alien film alien worst series extremely wellmade motion picture lot merits unfortunate thing surrounding second sequel onedimensional characters never really emotionally involved screen characters hardcore criminals really could care less despite ripley central figure thats important care even though began act like one guys technical side film remarkable better two previous versions camerons version pumped action film massive fincher uses brilliant camera angles terrific lighting moody sets cinematography alex

ladies gentlemen independence day title starship troopers surprisingly entertaining realize gave last years scifi hit star rating spell powerful first hour subsequent viewings feel independence day really wasnt great still give positive review starship troopers hand mocking sense humor knowing perfectly well ridiculous may seem result starship troopers exciting energetic lively science fiction film fact probably could never get tired watching film starship troopers star wars another kickass space opera scifi drama altogether starship troopers star wars comes quite close easiest assessment would call film star wars generous film perhaps science fiction film comes along mix humor romance effectively races essence science fiction pulp fiction easiest way write review film would compare science fiction films may starship troopers quite original film director paul verhoeven gives film style style except forced likely cause smith major role new star wars simple basic plot mankind vs alien species alien species question bugs seemingly advanced civilization insects however underlying morals starship troopers fleshed deadly accuracy sometimes morals buried bloody violence intense action scenes quiet moments realize starship troopers something tell us civilization likely morals quickly forgotten time movie ends doubt verhoeven intended film thoughtprovoking film event film surprisingly average extremely refreshing watch scifi war film actually root human side something independence day never achieved starship troopers begins satirical portrayal strange join army ads mixing events refreshingly original stating would like know short news give film immediate sense humor know take seriously however also witness murder several troopers battle gory yet funny way witnessing slaughter film jumps back one year setup saw introduced johnny rico casper van dien carmen denise richards rico flirts carmen sending messages computer school however carmen isnt interested rico becoming pilot however another classmate dizzy flores dina meyer eye rico unfortunately rico isnt interested dizzy setup rather cliched result setup still fun watch carmen signs become starship trooper result rico signs result dizzy signs everyone assigned certain position academy carmen gets pilot position wanted carl neil patrick harris psychic gets position training program rico left lowest class starship troopers mobile infantry main story follows rico trials relationships reality found watching space version place better special effects hour film war begins sense tension grew audience watched film first hour may funny sometimes unintentionally setup grew care flat characters matter hard tried like characters gorgeous looks call superficial must following training sessions many dramas many mention troopers sent war bugs live planet planet consists dirt rock pretty much nothing else many dramas occur war finally troopers realize something behind bugs attacks sort intelligence defense troopers ordered locate brain capture hopefully left plot vague possible starship troopers plot special effects gory violence director verhoeven known film showgirls basic instinct returns scifi days gave us good films like total recall verhoeven likes push envelope mpaa despite violence comic book feel gives film sense starship troopers extremely violent gore years event horizon rating well deserved hopefully parents allow year old children see guess verhoevens target audience male group film testosterone level charts chiseled men beautiful women despite superficial elements starship troopers also creates world made star wars successful watching film never second guess characters decisions seem perfectly clear thankfully hero punching aliens face gives flat characters depth identify cast starship troopers quite annoying begin soon grow casper van dien chiseled facial features tan skin make girls guys come across artificial fortunately van dien worst cast despite hard tries come real character dina meyer much better job character dizzy extremely likeable denise richards also good job scenes well done jake busey gary son gives wonderfully funny performance provides one biggest laughs film neil patrick harris remember doogie howser little wooden slightly place rest cast however give good performance michael ironside gives best performance film teacher one arm performance rises rest perhaps character developed think presence screen unfortunately particular cast member gives starmaking performance bad material could made many cast members stars director verhoeven main star film direction fast never slows pace makes wild ride writer edward adapted screenplay book robert heinlein writing usually funny sometimes corny dialogue smart smart arent required know everything plot holes left unanswered thankfully intended notice really dont except one mind quite amazingly wars romance going screenplay manages include surprising issues fact changes seem fairly plausible adds another layer story moral debate characters quite surprising find film genre even surprising amount humor included carnage havent laughed loud even comedies oh special effects first rate starship troopers rated graphic scifi violence gore language nudity believe say dont take young kids see film extremely violent fact probably violent film

love sam teaching class however two policemen ray duquette kevin bacon gloria perez daphne rubinvega want talk sex cheers crimes sex crime ray asks one student responds pretty much sets tone film watch however upon hearing one student suzie toller neve campbell stands leaves room kiss part body wild things sets motion quickly kelly begins hitting sam sam doesnt want anything advances kelly stubborn continues pursue even pleads let wash jeep surprisingly thats really tell plot would give away one many crucial plot twists whats plot twists actually unpredictable going along way scream wild things maintains films surprises adds even plot twists film probably ever seen even though think may get tired surprises genuine rather pleasing going back mind nearly work though stretch boundaries belief thankfully convoluted plot doesnt give us much time think one yet another twist us shock previous one worn critics complain film pretty much one trashy film however kind trashy isnt hard watch good trash sense one screenplay knows taken seriously includes lot humor satire story everywhere kellys mother theresa russell caricature rich people way lawyer bill murray wears cover insurance scam running bill murray also provides best character film genuine laughs two sex gratuitous although wild things supposed sex film title wouldnt movie breaks boundaries instead heterosexual sex scenes also includes lesbian scenes denise richards neve campbell dont worry graphic might think heterosexual scenes quite graphic surprise shocker kevin bacons nude scene brief blink may miss ahem long remember dont think seen rrated film show one completely judging audiences reaction expected also one scene late film seemed relationship brewing bacon characters nothing came makes wonder

without much range gets express emotions stiff yet effective performance starship troopers hopefully one day land good role display ability daphne rubinvega newcomer movies gives good performance although character mostly left background first hour half towards end get bigger part male side matt dillon probably best giving subtle performance surprises every twist kevin bacon slightly wooden character makes must admiration though screen judging many womens reactions theater shot grown deeper appreciation bacon yeah right bill murray performance comic relief nearly steals film whole entire cast works together seem home even troi director john mcnaughton previously done critically acclaimed henry portrait serial killer constructed wonderfully plot works direction smooth stylish visuals striking filled rich colors almost realistic actually breathe air however seems home actors arent talking shots areas brilliant photography denise richards climbing pool highlight cinematography gorgeous details often see film like watch see camera take pictures music probably obvious thing set perfect mood film hard describe words see film listen wonderfully composed presented sure stick around closing credits mcnaughton finally put ending credits good use comedies use outtakes included small scenes help explain preceding events may say lame attempts explain convoluted plot entertaining way finish film plus shocking moments ending credits add fun wild things appropriately rated strong sexuality nudity language violence nudity rather unnecessary lets face want see give neve campbell admirably clause contract see behind takes top way go neve sex scenes graphic especially first one see mother one deck hands one almost wonders got away rating language quite harsh

may seem weird begin film glam rock sequence includes spaceship green birth oscar one really strains see perhaps maybe connections half philosophy everyone true human nature result following philosophy imprisoned family career glam rock movement early england similar take came similar demise main difference placing makeup face acting deepest fantasies life mostly dealing sexuality became less less like like everyone else thats movement seemed end soon began said todd haynes velvet film chronicles like part movement experienced created steals lot citizen kane thats true film british journalist arthur stuart christian bale asked go back find happened glam rock star brian slade fictitious rock star faked death stage bringing end career entire glam rock movement totally steals kane setup interviews three people story result flashbacks things like beginning death smaller details like bitter wheelchair bitter exwife lounge singer found bar hours kane really doesnt aspire doesnt attempt deep outlook something gone like kane doesnt really uncover anything poignant humanity instead uses flashbacks form contrast magic glam rock era boredom life glam rock scenes dry melancholy equipped performance bale perhaps appropriately dull scenes engaging though mention campy gorgeous cinematography nicely vibrant colors era feel thats eerily lighthearted combined become symbol times everything seemed simple instead creating world way haynes paints world fairy tale glam rock movement full much freedom liberation youve experienced everything else seems mundane theres outside world speak people inside protective globe eventually crack haynes focuses story tale blade fictitious rock hero wild relationship created molded brought movement everyone else contributed merely blade played jonathan rhys meyers wild played anarchic ewan mcgregor little thinly disguised david bowie pop respectively complete creation persona named maxwell demon two rock stars may well partners music also partners bed discussions cecil michael feast exwife mandy toni collette american blonde dish fakes british accent slade finally wild journalist stuart begins remember experiences era like discovery conformity including moment began questioning sexuality opens first slade record finds naked green slade lying crimson finally running away home part london scene finally resulting leading boring job america haynes demonstrates hes quite visual auteur scenes like long heald seemingly long sequence concert performing brian cover babys fire scenes drug party films sequence first concert scene wild band mcgregor lets loose much anarchic steam wild movements including naked screams film captures perfect moment one discovers major talent another slade discovers idle even brief music videos spoofs rare visual flair thats pure camp would cause ken russell best sequence though may beginning following prelude sequence acts middle ground actual movement era stuart going infamous slade concert fakes death kills alter ego maxwell demon appears real brought end era one swift fake bullet brian famous needle eye playing background scene detached song doesnt seem played quite way songs distance thats hard put finger seems represent coming quick sad ending one sees slade dressing room show silver wings blue hair staring mirror comes prophecy finale beginning film movies much plot way presented making one films classified style substance statement many critics line attack however part engaging part film story rather way haynes creates world using sets costumes cinematography especially music play characters film music especially notable soundtrack wall wall consists old school glam rock tunes likes brian music well covers band occasionally rhys meyers even newer music shudder think sounds cast rather impressive one really walks away film performances extremely good although eddie manager challenges first manager match see gets control career michael feast first tragic manager come greatly collette mcgregor moments rhys meyers bale subpar neither putting lot effort respective roles fault actual construction film haynes rhys meyers brian slade remains merely metaphor glam rock era dying turned resorting life found lying around coke ass party girl fact one film really seen person rather symbol type era character especially tough sell bitter depressed flashbacks young adulthood hes extremely personal character cliched experiences record store guys buying record put never help us communicate nevertheless rhys meyers mcgregor characters really characters rather results era left others bitter part helps film work since major piece eye candy prime movie least look role leaders slade persona wild topless unpredictable image clash unstable

good long since good old fashioned thriller mostly everything goes right audience wrong characters even longer since saw thriller actually shock cared characters merely judged actually allowed human foibles flaws strengths emerge id saw least couple decades even far back great hitchcock thrillers though im hardly comparing simple plan say rear window strangers train yet almost good simple yet strangely complex astonishingly rewarding instead moving plot point plot point merely laying overtones instead concerns moral corruption depths greed protagonists go without ever judging either evil even elegantly directed sam raimi yes simple plan concerns discovery crashed plane within bag full millions dollars moderately financially stable working man bill paxton dimwitted brother billy bob thornton drinking buddy brent without anyone around possibility one would come looking three debate debate finally reach decision yes keep authorities possible owners cash come looking generally dont flaunt anything dont want flaunt theyll keep away custody paxton circumstance much diverse could endlessly play cat mouse authorities could try fight owners either villainous could fight amongst simple plan though borrows little little cops subplot involving alleged fbi agent chilling gary cole bit inside austin powers would say thats necessarily bag baby admired film makes far superior unique thriller successfully able cake eat effectively involves traditional thriller cliches like ones mentioned time involves deeply way characters become morally corrupt price pay think happiness black bag steps taken neatly cover things subsequent steps go miserably awry film choses never loose sight covering things extent characters slowly losing souls humanity one early scene paxton thornton make trip back plane return money doesnt look like stolen bad idea thornton screws continuously throughout movie paxton major read homicide instead quick murder raimi shows lengthy painful shot onto face tries emotions reach conclusion theres similar shot afterwards paxton watching murder hes committing taking horror also wonderfully effective previous shot even better morally complex short probably best piece direction ever done demonstrating sometimes way something yields best results proof watch persona sex scene witness may best scene ever done film hardly stops follows completely rarely loses sight characters humanity thereof yet also moves step step graceful method never feel like film merely plot points story time comes paxton start becoming selfish thus diabolical aid pregnant wife played bridget fonda pal raimi soon horror situation tragic heights theres least two grand shootouts least one may one greatest shootouts cinema history arrive dont come delight cringeinducing horror one actually sinking chair mantra cant head fact film getting many comparisons coens superior forget fargo many similar moments manic insanity attributed major amount subtlety restraint directors direct hands would overthetop imagine suppose robert rodriguez directing seeing evil dead films id hardly assume raimi would able pull something like although moments film easily dubbed raimi moments notwithstanding instead raimi directs maturity gentle touch easily letting story characters still letting traditional raimi elements come like offbeat comic touches particularly billy bob character jacob brilliant creation often hilarious film every line uttered greeted howling laughter theres authenticity performance strangely enough makes sure totally laughing chuckles gets necessarily ones thornton damn real jacobs multidimensional character stupid see much flaw strength character simplicity endearing many acts commits strong inner strength belief system primarily towards middle bud begins make heavy waves concerning money final third film spends much time many touches upon character thornton also screenwriter scott smith adapting book way great particularly admired back story old high school girlfriend told thornton sincerity cruel story reversed strength character thornton absolutely brilliant performance far best performance hes ever given proof hes best character actor contemporary cinema dont believe go back watch wonderful performance primary colors performance would nominated oscar hadnt year hes easily able slip character make completely utterly believable brings much weight film character actors difficult anyone else role rest cast great working man ross amiable town sheriff even fonda shows talents nicely complaints film plot almost simplistic times seems much like exercise like cruel test humanity still pays attention humanity involved occasional narration usually annoying narration used extreme caution especially youre trying set things andor express emotions didnt raimi watch first murder scene thing usually go wrong movie ending basically wont reveal way cruel much outsider setup appearance plane wasnt already much anyway film deals much humanity characters involved wrong ending imagine ending otherwise like crime punishment police caught instead breaking im comparing simple plan ending work despite something incessantly nagging unsatisfying happy ignore go day despite mere claims make mistake completely utterly edge seat throughout even sometimes situations kind gore factor thankfully minimal film places characters situations gives painful things overcome ive frankly seen much like quite awhile least since previous worthy masterpiece	1

home hen wen brought home dangers past even await triumphant return spectacular sounds black cauldron really suffered lot past times ron miller fired position chairman walt disney productions bought novel lloyd alexander called black cauldron sword tale studio bringing book screen studios dream miller entitled executive producer promised would proved projects executives arrived disney animation studio animators struggling complete black cauldron time things gone really rocky animation department many studios old men retired died therefore animators suffered hard time making film originally million costs raised million constant changes everything finally released june black cauldron greeted praising reviews critics somehow film flopped film rated pg film although lloyd chronicles film based much scarier darker disneys previous efforts fox hound probably many people considered scary stayed away addition critics rejected heart compared disney animated features whatever real reason black cauldron financial disaster grossing million failure film grounded studios animation department exiled animation team buildings nearby seemed like animated features would longer become part studios reputation next two disney animated features great mouse detective oliver company although little lighthearted black cauldron didnt much better although oliver company grossed much black cauldron great mouse detective little mermaid studio regain reputation successful animated features black cauldron rereleased cities time title taran magic cauldron finally studio locked film film vault denied ever even released might ask black cauldron really bad movie people seen film didnt think fact many people calls home video film course denied seemed like black cauldron would never released video september disney released black cauldron video united kingdom people video england converted including hadnt seen film yet included got quite treat people copies black cauldron noticed scene horned king raises army warriors seconds looking skeletons slightly trimmed film would get rating uk rating means universal suitable ages kinda like version somewhere online team diehard black cauldron fans signed said bring back black cauldron disney finally decided release video united states time rumors online made video would trimmed like uk video would get rating would add songs rumors put rest walt disney company announced black cauldron would released pg rated version even still finally released us reaction mixed felt indeed cut felt wasnt minor criticisms seemed laughable since film absent thirteen years finally available saw movie first time converted video didnt expect much fact heard many mediocre things didnt think film would ever good film much surprise saw first minutes film asking film everyone saw one flopped box office one critics alike called bad movie doesnt seem like instead classic right film wonderful cast characters theres taran grant assistant pig would rather warrior storys hero critics said taran likeable opposite true brave loyal eventually learns lesson friendship later theres likeable character hes likeable character film theres gurgi john lovable little uh thing remains loyal taran even though dont quite hit first another likeable character bad guy comic henchman named phil loyal films imaginative sinister villain horned king voiced gruesomely john hurt yet also fears neck characters including sidekicks spunky sweet princess named eilonwy comic bard fflewdurr three comically wicked witches hide dark secret although pleasant likeable arent quite well story adventurous one quest involving mystical pig hen wen black cauldron army ones everything opening spectacular finale music also tells story perfectly dark yet manner animation surprisingly good considering film created darkest time studios even though occasional effects quite good like ground opening black cauldron rises earth animation overall top notch overall film entertaining fans unfamiliar lloyd alexander chronicles get kick one except young kids extremely scary scenes darker disneys films although consider sequence lion king observing fires hell hunchback notre dame scary main reason film rated pg fans familiar lloyd alexander series recognize differences novel movie even though doesnt ingredients true disney film film classic right deserves

priests observed ancient prophecy says girl born night satan targeted midnight december world destroyed pope orders protection girl though priests believe ought killed new york night girl born fulfill prophecy twenty years later meet jericho cane schwarzenegger suicidal excop drinking problem working security guard hire protecting local businessman gabriel byrne actually possessed devil assassination attempt businessman crazed former priest leads girl satan christine york robin tunney recognizing elements murdered daughter christine including ownership music box apparently jericho swears protect devil priests looking kill many problems film hard know begin starting concept casting arnold role like mistake begin schwarzenegger persona actor putting role usual strong personality bad idea arnold neither dramatic range speaking ability pull character tormented conflicting emotions words trying give dimension mistake harrison ford mel gibson even bruce willis could played role theyve played noble flawed heroes schwarzenegger several scenes attempt establish character one contemplating suicide another crying loss wife daughter even one devil tries revealing location offering old life back none scenes really work arnie isnt task filmmakers would better making jericho strong confident character like terminator example likes schwarzenegger one isnt believable way arnold plays supporting cast tries hardest gabriel byrne makes impact prince darkness hes suave confident acts like one would expect devil act problem script things make sense later undermines powerful villain byrne arnold every scene together including aforementioned temptation bit problematic causes audience start root devil byrnes speech bible overrated actually starts make sense mainly arnolds attempts mostly variety feeble best problem arnold win end nobody really cares kevin pollack plays security guard sidekick tries liven things comic asides like bad action movie sidekicks disappears hour robin tunney isnt given much except look scared fact supporting players good actors none save byrne given anything interesting performances aside would really hard enjoy film matter starred action blockbuster surprise worst thing script starts totally confusing explained much utterly ridiculous devil coming new years eve exactly years year devil isnt turns nutty priest accidentally read upside real year add beginning youve got dont buy explanation youre alone convoluted silly time method jericho christine york equally ludicrous shes christine see lives new york see werent bad enough theres plenty bothersome stuff film isnt explained satan kill everyone passes street comes one drunk excop hes powerless one kind bullet come cant control jericho christine monks deal time clumsy attempt joke made never actually explained usually sort thing wouldnt matter schwarzenegger flick mean dont get started time offered terminator movies time plot inconsistencies stand even usual action rarely exciting several predictable horror film clich present end days complete old black cat hiding cabinet bit ever find cat gets formulaic possible scared close eyes precise moment boo come rarely wrong grandiose action sequences utterly charmless partially dont care characters due scripts pathetic attempts characterization setup also dont make sense theres scene schwarzenegger gets thrown around room little old lady good chuckles much else supposedly believe super strength virtue controlled satan script never sets scene merely silly none terribly exciting action sequences badly framed often hard tell happening first place mention theyre edited incomprehensible mtv style scratching head rather saying wow cool end days silly confusing also distinctly unpleasant watch devil apparently doesnt operate subtle fashion bible instead enjoys killing people gruesomely broad daylight doesnt make awfully predictable sort also means single scene end days goes without unnecessarily graphic violence odd kinky sexual encounter yet another bit scratching head violence supposed shocking good idea throw much movie audience goes numb scenes arent connected reasonable means lot time stuff gets blown people get killed idea reasons hell reasons lets blow stuff isnt cool nope long shot film thoroughly unwatchable dull interminable stupidity perhaps arnold needs make movies james cameron revive career happening hack peter hyams end days might camp value didnt top overly ending nobodys going buy movie going serious filmmakers come decent script going campy arnold shouldnt taking damn seriously didnt actually see put cross character shouldnt sad sack stands end days bad movie awfully gloomy one	0
