initially set review film tag line going believe whales fly going believe fly going believe wood fly finally gave trying come tag line decided say theres lot flying going film first host steve martin tells us original concept behind fantasia bring every year old segments new segments added well apparently plan fell approximately sixty years passed since original classic released part might something cold reception film got first released grossing somewhere close original month release subsequent film elevated popularity film classic status finally achieved rightfully deserved celebrate release updated version fantasia disney imax teamed present animated film fashion one seen six stories high exclusive four month engagement january april fantasia seen many imax theaters across us engagement film shown regular theaters format effective film exceptions yes first segment presented set fifth symphony hard describe exactly segment involves bunch brightly colored butterfly looking happily everything seems going great little things ground erupts evil black attack lighter counterparts eventually light help drive away evil things peace returns butterfly things though segment isnt story driven images visually strong especially scene dark cloud bat things blood red colors begin skies next segment set pines rome segment whales swim happily ocean eventually emerge water fly around massive pepper whale gets nearby birds flight ends getting trapped giant iceberg trying avoid birds attack finally saved another liberating shaft light take skies fly upper atmosphere clouds visuals key segment especially whales involved reportedly whales viewed imax screen certain sequences shown actual size cgi whales look incredibly except cartoon eyes drawn onto images one especially striking image involves giant shadow one whales cast wall iceberg whale tries find way parent absolutely beautiful stuff third segment least eight segments set george blue segment designed tribute acclaimed al four different stories sad souls living depression era new york theres construction worker dreams jazz sad sack dreams job young girl dreams spending time parents instead dreams free overbearing wife wont go everything works fine disney tradition happy ending unfortunately story drags quite bit seems place within hyper reality rest segments segment four set piano animated version hans christian tin soldier one toy tin soldier falls love clock assumes also one cant see leg extended behind much dismay evil jester jester knocks soldier window continues pursuing little jester know soldier sewer fish captured sold owner set tin soldiers one one comes soldier eventually saves day gets girl although ending altered story tin soldier told framework seven minute short children may find jester little frightening otherwise segment well made segment five funniest bunch set camille carnival animals segment features fellow trying perform choreographed dance number clip group dancing first fantasia still well accomplished welcome bit comedy segment six segment repeated original fantasia one people remember apprentice story recognizable draw seeing enormous imax screen remastered stereo unfortunately segment wasnt made presented large format film considering shot full frame exhibits large amounts grain least two occasions images hard make due excessive grain similar problems crop modern day releases projected screens large image shown accurately one seems notice strange reason common many screen theaters segment seven set sir edward circumstance march fantasia segment feature stock disney character donald duck stars assistant noah whose task loading animals onto ark loading donald wife lose sight believe one didnt make boat constantly missing due comic misadventures mainly involving donald crushed animals various despite slapstick style comedy piece displays emotion final scene many audiences days powerful stuff segment eight brings whole new meaning clich saving best last set awakens forest sprite proceeds change landscape beautiful landscape trees flowers blossom everything seems going well sprite becomes large mountain strange formation sprite examines formation awakens becomes titular stunning spectacle back fire storm destroys everything path including everything sprite worked create amazing animation present well worth ten dollars ticket alone although brush strokes evident one scene due film host segments largely pun intended although steve martins clip pretty funny sure stay credits little humor martin penn usually funny gags seem routine therefore uninteresting best segment comes people gets tell us abandoned segments never made drawing board pieces like flight take four set ride strange segment prepared never shown may appear future installments fans visual classical music fantasia perfect way spend afternoon film also decent family entertainment contains little material mentioned earlier review ten dollars seems like much spend film fear run imax theaters going brought regular theaters must stress best way see film imax screen though believe fly

phantom menace takes place decades setting original films film opens obiwan kenobi ewan mcgregor wise old master introduced luke force original star wars young jedi apprentice still learning fellow jedi instructor quigon jinn liam neeson republic government sent two jedi settle trade dispute developed blockade planet naboo shifty trade federation jedi quickly find negotiations middle invasion rushing protect young queen amidala natalie portman later eventually rescuing amidala helping escape naboo forced stop tatooine ship bringing galactic senate make appeal justice tatooine quigon discovers young slave boy anakin skywalker jake lloyd help get parts need displays uncanny intelligence insight instincts quigon senses child unusually strong force begins suspect may one bring balance force anyone watched original star wars trilogy knows far galactic savior time become ruthless darth vader complicating matters mysterious figure darth behind trade blockade invasion naboo sends lethal apprentice darth maul find capture queen amidala amidala jedi fight save planet soon also deal deadly relentless darth maul plot sounds bit complicated phantom menace introduces earlier generation characters immediate crisis sets foundation events eventually lead fall republic demise jedi knights turn evil rise dark empire original trilogy complexity overwhelming story moves quickly drawback many questions predictably remain unanswered end film setting stage next episode one reasons films story seems confusing unfocused unclear whose story phantom menace original trilogy movies clearly story stories around growth rebel hero jedi knight unclear whether new film story trilogy centered anakin shaky foundation lloyd like many child actors lacks subtle acting skills adult performers result character seems shallow unimpressive screen see nothing suggests dark side lurking underneath face matter presence would make seem special quigon willing believe one rest cast fine though often work dialogue lucas neeson perfect aging jedi knight mcgregor obiwan conveys balance youthful energy calm sensibility portman fits role young queen well lines often formal giving little room give character much personality biggest problem phantom menace plot characters interaction characters new film less developed original star wars storyline confusing previous films series unlike previous trilogy lucas doesnt good job playing characters one another star wars immediate contrasts memorable exchanges luke han han obiwan leia luke ensemble played immediately showed distinct attitudes personalities sequence luke han chewbacca attempt rescue leia cell death star audience learns lot four characters ways react immediate problems comparable sequence phantom menace flesh characters relationships interesting characters clear motivations interests lucas develops little chemistry tension perhaps glaring weakness film probably reason disappointed many reviewers despite need richer dialogue stronger character interaction film still engaging many wonderful elements lucas previous films make phantom menace memorable entertaining first course remarkably rich imaginative universe lucas creates characters visit magical underwater cities sea monsters fight battle droids menacing planet naboo watch spectacular event part race part circuit desert planet tatooine head gothic urban capital republic home galactic senate jedi council location elaborate complex lucas never settles vague ideas look settings creates rich spectacular new special effects rereleased special edition trilogy changes allowed give earlier movies look feel werent possible films made ever new film lucas universe filled creatures robots personalities supporting cast aliens interact main characters best character greedy tatooine junk dealer owns anakin mother slaves italian voice short body oddly mismatched wings like floats around room computergenerated characters film best done enjoyable speaking computergenerated characters review phantom menace complete without mentioning controversial figure film jar jar binks minutes screen time jar jar realization george lucas dream include fully computergenerated character cast new trilogy jar jar clumsy member race literally stumbles way path jedi knights early film becomes accidental sidekick jar jar usually performs role film scenes inability stay trouble animation jar jar nearly seamless characters throughout film really set actors however despite technological magic makes character possible jar jar isnt completely

jar annoying grew enjoy humor added film second viewing film jar jar lot fun didnt mind second reason film continues fine tradition star wars movies film replete humor small details flesh world lucas creates despite films struggles good evil sober ones destiny force like star wars films phantom menace never takes seriously fortunately lucas hasnt lost sight fact films entertainment high art bumbling jar jar team calling action films thrilling sequence cameo appearance film phantom menace simply lot fun lots jokes humor easily missed finally phantom menace works films speed action beginning end battles chases thrilling good evil sequence tatooine one entertaining exciting scenes star wars film final showdown obiwan quigon darth maul arguably best choreographed thrilling fight sequence lucas filmed phantom menace wont win major oscars probably wont beat titanics box office record even best star wars film id put third original empire strikes back exciting entertaining film far better typical summer blockbuster film cant live hype film even original star wars could done still worth seeing probably
